\section{Survey and Identified Problems}

  A survey was conducted to collect opinions about Blackboard and some problems were identified such as difficulty in dealing with the system and some technical problems such as difficulty in submitting assignments, which we examined through the survey and which most students suffer from. Among the solutions to this problem is making improvements in building the application, which will improve the strength of the application's performance and increase the speed of receiving assignments. Also, the difficulty of communication methods between teachers and students due to the lack of realistic conversations to communicate between them. Therefore, we decided to improve communication by creating a chat interface that allows communication between teachers and students in the application.
  
  
  Explains the differences between blackboard and madrasty in terms of advantages and disadvantages.
